# Handwritten_Digit_Recognizer
<br>Firstly, I train the models using MNIST Dataset and ccompare them to find MLPClassifier() perform the best.
<br>The numbers are written in grid. The extraction of digits from the grid is the main task. Using opencv library, I try to detect the horizontal and vertical lines, and extract the digits. Finally, convert 28x28 image to 784 array to input it into the model for prediction.
<br> Following result is observed:-
<br>
<br><b> Image of test data
<br>
<br><img src = 'result/image.jpg'>
<br>
<br>Detection of digits </b>
<br>
<br><img src = 'result/image2.jpg'>
<br>
